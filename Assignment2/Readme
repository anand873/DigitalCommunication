Assignment 2 - Huffman and LZ Coding Schemes.	

1) Generated The Random Sequence Using TPM;
2) Used LZ78 Algorithm To Encode The String.
3) Used Huffman Algorithm To Encode The String.

Bit Per Symbol In Huffman 	: Around 2.83 (May vary from run to run)
Bit Per Symbol In LZ78 		: Around 3.33 (May vary from run to run)

NOTE: 	A character is taken as 8 bit
	while the encoded data is binary (1 bit per symbol).
        Since it is still made as a string in C++
	actual file size may be larger.
